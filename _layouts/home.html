                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">An imageboard is a type of Internet forum that revolves around the posting of images, often alongside text and discussion. The first imageboards were created in Japan as an extension of the textboard concept. These sites later inspired the creation of a number of English-language imageboards, such as 4chan. Imageboards, similar to bulletin board systems, are used for discussions of a variety of topics.</a>
